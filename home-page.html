It is truly an honor to be serving as your elected representative for the City of San José. As a lifelong resident of San José, a graduate of downtown’s very own San José State University, and as a former San José Police Officer, I can wholeheartedly say that I am a tireless advocate and champion for our City.

Since becoming your councilmember in 2015, I have taken action to address our City's public safety, transportation, economic development and housing needs. Downtown San José is at the epicenter of incredible change, and the decisions we make today will shape our City for generations to come. As residents, business owners and stakeholders in District 3, we all play a vital role in its development. With dedicated staff members, your D3 team and I continue to work passionately and diligently to be good stewards and representatives of our District.

Our vision: Work to make San José a city where everyone can afford to live, find dignified work, and play in peace.

While we have celebrated many successes, there is still much work ahead and I look forward to making progress together in the years to come. 

Thank you again for visiting,
