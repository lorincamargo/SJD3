<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years ago, I became your representative as Councilmember for District 3. In those three years, a lot of work has been done. The year began with great opportunities in the areas of transportation where I represented you as a board member for Caltrain, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), and as the chair of Caltrain's Local Policy Maker Group helping oversee the local High Speed Rail updates. We received new staff members, and like always, your D3 team and I continued to work passionately and diligently to represent all the residents and businesses of District 3. In spite of all these changes and opportunities, our vision has not changed.</span>

<b>Our vision: Work to make San José a city where everyone can afford to live, find dignified work, and play in peace.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this vision and my priorities for the city in mind, we continued our work, and together, the City of San José accomplished much last year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing & Homelessness</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enactment of AB 2176, the tiny home amendment, which was the first step in addressing the city's declared housing crisis.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city's easement on development restrictions for secondary units to ensure that housing becomes more available to those seeking to live in San José.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The passing of the Apartment Ordinance (ARO) that ensures rental protections by dropping the cap a landowner may raise rent from 8% to 5% increase per year.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Established and restarted new community associations such as Orchard Park and the East Santa Clara Business Association, and ensured the ones existing had the support and access to resources needed to continue their great work.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We attended over 200 neighborhood and community meetings.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we have continued our difficult yet great work with our homeless response team throughout the city.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Safety</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a city, we passed Measure F, enabling us to attract and retain our police officers that help to protect and serve San José.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We worked on combatting suspected prostitution in the growing number of massage parlors</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposed a Gun Violence Prevention Initiative for the city.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Community & Sustainability</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outstanding success and progress from our first year of implementing our Participatory Budgeting program, and the continued enthusiasm and participation in this years D3 Decides.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of our first ever D3 Youth Expo for Sustainability (D3YES), that empowered students to present their ideas on how we as a city can adopt the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We participated and won the Great American Litter Pick Up with over 500 volunteers cleaning and beautifying our neighborhoods.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted a screening of the award-winning documentary "Indivisible" to educate residents on issues related to immigration.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Business & Commerce</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-established with the San Jose Downtown Association the Food, Beverage & Entertainment Committee.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosponsored several workshops for the community to discuss and better understand incoming development</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our newsletter featured over 20 locally owned businesses to promote and help support local small business.  </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a lifelong resident of San José, a graduate of downtown’s very own San José State University, and as a former San José Police Officer, I can wholeheartedly say that I am an advocate and champion for our city through and through. I would like to let you know that your D3 team and I will continue to work passionately and rigorously to represent all the residents and businesses of District 3.  There is much work ahead of us, and while it has been great to experience all that has happened since 2016, I look forward to more progress the years ahead. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you again for visiting,</span>
