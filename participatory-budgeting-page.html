[header color= "2" title="What is Participatory Budgeting?"]

[pb color ="3" description="In 2015, the Mayor announced a new opportunity for San Jos√© City Council to allot a portion of the City's budget to projects that are decided by residents through participatory budgeting. I answered this call and became the first Councilmember in our City's history to allow district residents to collectively create, discuss, and vote on community improvement projects through our program entitled D3Decides. Every year, District 3 residents look forward to submitting ideas, voting on proposals, and implementing community born ideas in their own neighborhood. With D3Decides, community members have learned about budgeting, project costs and implementation. Most importantly, they've connected to their City by building relationships with department staff, council staff, and district residents from differing neighborhoods." description-2="In 2017, over 3000 residents participated in deciding how $250,000 would be implemented throughout District 3. Our D3Decides program is once again around the corner, and we look forward to the thousands of ideas community members will submit to better their neighborhood!"]
