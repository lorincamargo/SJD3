  <h2>Real Money. Real Projects. Real Power.</h2>
  Participatory budgeting has become a proven means of democratizing civic governance in hundreds of cities globally, enabling residents to directly decide how to spend a portion of the City’s budget. In June 2015, Councilmember Raul Peralez responded to Mayor Sam Liccardo’s call to action in his March budget message, becoming the first councilmember in the city’s history to allow district residents to collectively create, discuss, and vote upon on community improvement projects . Together, Mayor Liccardo and Councilmember Peralez officially launched the pilot process in late 2015 with hundreds of engaged neighbors.

  Due to the success of the 2015-2016 D3Decides program, Councilmember Peralez has elected to continue the program into the 2016-2017 fiscal year with a larger amount of $250,000. Following the pilot, Council District 2 and District 5 also began their own participatory budgeting process.<p><br><br></p>
